    <p>Few days back, I was tasked on a project. This app will be written in React. State management will be with Apollo with a backend in GraphQL. The way I learn new things is I do a very basic course to get the feel of it. I look for a free course, so that I can share it with the community. GraphQL being relatively new has fewer courses online. I did find a lot of resources both free and paid which I will review some day but this one course stands out. I have recommended this course to a lot many people I know.</p>

    <h1>rating 4/5</h1>
    <p>While this course covers a lot of ground, it misses few. Also, it is little bit outdated. Nonetheless, the course is still my favorite for beginners. </p>

    <p><strong>pace</strong> is remarkably right, it’s neither too fast that you have to go back nor slow that you start doozing</p>

    <p><strong>full screencast</strong> of code, I like where I don’t have to see someone’s face too much and the instructor explains things on codepad. So, this was a huge +</p>

    <p><strong>great example</strong> for the entire tutorial as it covers why GraphQL is an ideal solution. TODO apps wouldn’t do justice to the concepts of GQL.</p>

    <h1>what you need to know to do this course?</h1>
    <p>To do this course you need to know the following pieces of technology:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>NodeJS</li>
        <li>ExpressJS</li>
        <li>ReactJS</li>
